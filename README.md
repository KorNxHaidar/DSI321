### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is part of the <b>DSI321: BIG DATA INFRASTRUCTURE</b> course.The objective is to design and implement automated data pipelines using Prefect.io for real-time analytics. The system is containerized with Docker and supports visualizing data insights with Python libraries.

### ðŸ§¾ Introduction 
In recent years, air pollutionâ€”especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5)â€”has become a critical environmental issue in Thailand <img src="https://flagcdn.com/w40/th.png" alt="Thailand Flag" width="16" height="12"> . Accurate and timely monitoring of air quality is essential for public awareness, health decision-making, and long-term policy planning. To support this need, this project focuses on building an automated data pipeline that continuously collects, processes, and analyzes air quality data in near real-time.
<br>
<br>
The pipeline utilizes the <a href=https://envilink.go.th/dataset/air-quality-pm2point5/resource/156ca885-4f38-4c58-8745-397552105c1e><b>Air Quality API</b></a>, which provides hourly average PM2.5 concentration data from automatic air quality monitoring stations operated by the <b>Air4Thai</b> network across the country. This API is officially maintained by the <b>Pollution Control Department of Thailand</b>, offering reliable access to high-quality environmental data.
<br>
<br>
By leveraging <a href=https://www.prefect.io><b> Prefect.io</b></a> for workflow orchestration and <a href=https://www.docker.com><b>Docker</b></a> for containerization, this project ensures scalability, reproducibility, and seamless automation.
<br>
<br>
To make insights more accessible and interactive, the processed data is visualized through a user-friendly web dashboard built with Streamlit. The dashboard allows users to explore real-time PM2.5 levels across various regions in Thailand, view historical trends, and better understand the countryâ€™s air quality through an intuitive web interface.
